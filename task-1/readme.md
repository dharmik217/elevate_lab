### 🚀 AI & ML Internship - Task 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

[cite_start]This repository contains the solution for the Elevate Labs AI & ML Internship Task 1[cite: 3], which focuses on data cleaning and preprocessing. [cite_start]The objective was to learn how to clean and prepare raw data for a machine learning model[cite: 4].

### 📚 What Was Learned

[cite_start]During this task, I gained hands-on experience in several crucial data science concepts[cite: 14]:
* [cite_start]**Data Cleaning:** The process of preparing raw data for ML[cite: 4].
* [cite_start]**Handling Nulls:** I used imputation methods to handle missing values[cite: 8].
* [cite_start]**Encoding Categorical Features:** I converted categorical features into numerical ones using encoding[cite: 9].
* [cite_start]**Feature Scaling:** I applied normalization/standardization to numerical features[cite: 10].
* [cite_start]**Outlier Detection:** I used boxplots to visualize and identify outliers[cite: 11].
