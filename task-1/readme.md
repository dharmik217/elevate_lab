üöÄ AI & ML Internship - Task 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
This repository contains the solution for the Elevate Labs AI & ML Internship Task 1, which focuses on data cleaning and preprocessing. The primary objective was to learn how to clean and prepare raw data for a machine learning model.


üìö What Was Learned
During this task, I gained hands-on experience in several crucial data science concepts:




Data Cleaning: The process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset.


Handling Nulls: Techniques for managing missing values, such as using imputation methods like mean or median imputation.




Encoding Categorical Features: Converting categorical features into a numerical format, which is essential for most machine learning algorithms. I used techniques like one-hot encoding.



Feature Scaling: Methods like normalization and standardization to scale numerical features to a standard range, which helps improve model performance.




Outlier Detection: Identifying and handling data points that are significantly different from other observations in the dataset, often done using visualizations like boxplots.



üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
Python: The main programming language used for the task.


Pandas: A library used for data manipulation and analysis.



NumPy: A library for numerical operations.



Matplotlib/Seaborn: Libraries for data visualization, specifically for detecting outliers with boxplots.


Scikit-learn: A library used for various machine learning tasks, including preprocessing pipelines for imputation and scaling.

üìÇ Repository Contents
task1_code.ipynb (or .py): The main Python notebook/script containing the complete code for data cleaning and preprocessing.

üîç Key Concepts Covered
The task required exploring and understanding several fundamental concepts, including:


Missing Data: Different types of missing data and how to handle them.


Categorical Variables: Methods for converting categorical data into a usable format for models.


Normalization vs. Standardization: The difference between these two feature scaling techniques.


Outlier Detection: How to identify outliers in a dataset.


Preprocessing Importance: Why preprocessing is a crucial step in the machine learning workflow and how it affects model accuracy.



One-Hot Encoding vs. Label Encoding: The difference between these two popular encoding techniques.
